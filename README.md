# Bartender
A machine to accurately dispense alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks.

## Project Overview

How many times have you gone to an event where the bartender made bad drinks? There are a lot of drinks going to waste due to this.

## Project Goals

* Team of 3 people.
* Needs to be universal.
* Navigate the user from Makerspace are to the cafeteria without hitting obstructions.
* Buy pizza slice in the cafeteria.
* Give user feedback to know where the obstuctions are and which direction they should go.
* Allow user to have both hands free for holding things.
* Ability to replace and enhance the "walking stick".
* Develop electronic/embedded system that would help complete the task.
* The user must be blindfolded the entire time, no visual feedback allowed.
* Teammates are not allowed to help the person navigate.
* No direct tactile feedback (you can use a stick, but cannot feel with a stick, placing a sensor on it is fine).
